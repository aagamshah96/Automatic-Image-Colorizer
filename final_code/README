As discussed earlier we will have these files in out code .

The file get_features will be responsible for making superpixels, getting fft and putting it in a matrix which will be made global.

THe train.m and test.m will have code from ridge code .

Assumption:

    The train image will be in ../data/train directory and testing images will be ../data/test directory
